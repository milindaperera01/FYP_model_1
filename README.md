# HEEGNET: HYPERBOLIC EMBEDDINGS FOR EEG

This repository contains code accompanying the ICLR 2026 paper *HEEGNET: HYPERBOLIC EMBEDDINGS FOR EEG*.

## File list

The following files are provided in this repository:

`demo.ipynb` A jupyter notebook demonstrating SPDIM can compensate the conditional and label shifts in EEG source-free unsupervised domain adaptation problem.

`nets` A folder containing the HEEGNet hybrid hyperbolic deep learning framework.

`Geometry`, `hsssw`, `lib`  three folders contain hyperbolic space operations.

`pretrained_models` A folder containing the pretrained model for the source domains, enabling immediate source-free unsupervised domain adaptation.


## Requirements

All dependencies are managed with the `conda` package manager.
Please follow the user guide to [install](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html) `conda`.

Once the setup is completed, the dependencies can be installed in a new virtual environment.

Open a jupyter notebook and run it.
